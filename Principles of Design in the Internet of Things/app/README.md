# Iot Application

Android application designed to classify movement and respiratory activities, with a particular focus on detecting "shuffle walking" - a common early symptom of Parkinson's disease. 

Can be built out-the-box using Adroid Studio

Uses the RESpeck and Nordic:Thingy52 sensors. The respeck is attached to the lower left side of the torso (just below the floating rib) and the Thingy is placed in your right front pocket. The app uses Bluetooth LE to connect to both sensors for long stretches of time.
